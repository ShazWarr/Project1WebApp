                I love spending time with my litle brother. Everyone in family always had brothers except me. Finally
                in 2015 I had gotten a brother too. Sometimes he can be difficult to deal with but most of the time we are inseperable. 
                We go fishing whenever we can and enjoy wrestling, gaming and watching movies together.

                    Another thing I really love is sports in general, specifically boxing, and wrestling. I've boxed for a long time, but 
                    after a while I got bored with it and wanted to try out wrestling. It has been a pleasant suprise. I found it to be much
                    more difficult. I love both but the switch really allowed me to appreciate boxing more while also learning more about
                    another sport.

                        One more thing I love to do and have been doing since a kid is, gaming. I particularly like playing games on Playstation. 
                        I remember from a young age falling in love with games. I still play occasionally to blow off some steam.
                        Multiplayer games are cool and all but I mostly enjoy games that are single-player with a good, compelling story and 
                        characters.
